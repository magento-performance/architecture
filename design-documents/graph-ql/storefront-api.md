# Storefront API (implementation details)

 
## Purpose
Working on [lightweight GraphQL resolvers](https://github.com/magento-performance/architecture/blob/graphql/design-documents/graph-ql/lightweight-resolver.md) we want to introduce new API
that is responsible for retrieving Storefront specific data

## Design 
New API should satisfy the following criteria:
1. Support batch requests
1. All services must be stateless
1. Be performance efficient
1. Keep service isolation in mind 

Here is a detailed design description which satisfies above criteria: [Batch query services](https://github.com/magento/architecture/pull/163/files?short_path=6bf9437#diff-6bf9437e365a3d978a3743fe86d815f5)

Technical vision of [StoreFront API](https://github.com/magento/architecture/blob/1c3bad3908bb90f45d020fd182881520057678a1/design-documents/storefront/storefront-api.md)

## Structure

* API module (**Magento\CatalogProductAPI**)
  * Contains API's for specific domain layer
* Implementations (**Magento\CatalogProduct**)
  * Basic implementation for specific API

### Technical notes

The main goal is performance. Here are some requirements that each new service should follow:
1. Be lazy: to return only requested data
1. Be greedy: to aggregate requests and execute query only once
1. Be lightweight: to return simple structures

## Product Search API


```php

// Product Search Request Criteria
interface ProductSearchRequestInterface
{
// set filtrations 
    public function getSearchTerm(): ?string;
    public function getFilters(): array;
    public function getPage(): array;
    public function getScopes(): array;
    public function getSort(): ?array;

// request data
    public function getAttributes(): ?array;
    public function getAggregations(): ?array;
    public function getMetaInfo(): ?array;
}
```

### Filtration

1. Only AND filters supported
1. OR filters are not supported

If there is a necessity to execute a request with OR filter, it should be re-written as 2 requests instead.
For layered navigation (faceted search) where multi-select checkbox filtering supported, the request will look like 
Size IN (10, 10.5) instead of Size 10 OR 10.5 
Because in this case attribute values are always finite set, and their cardinality (number of unique values) is quite limited

### Sorting

Despite our API supports several fields for sorting here are some agreements that we will follow:
1. Sort by relevance is applied by default in case of full text search, if no other sort is provided
1. For mix sort by specified field and relevance you should explicitly set sort by relevance


### Scopes
1. Each scope consist of name and value, e.g. name: "store", value: "5".
1. API consumer pass all known scopes to API (store, customer_group)
1. API implementation utilize needed scpoes.
1. Exception is thrown in case of scope is missed

### Requested data

From the performance perspective, we must return only requested data.

Requested data are splitted into 3 groups:
1. attributes
1. aggregations
1. meta info

Dot.notations is used for retrieve multi-level fields:
```php
// Request
{
  "arguments": [
      "multi.level.option",
      "name"
  ],
}

// Response
 {
    "items": [
        {
            "multi": [
               {
                 "level": [
                     {
                        "option": "data"
                     }
                  ]
               }
            ],
            "name": "product name"
        }
    ]
}


```
#### Attributes

Allows to specify entity attributes, that need to be requested

#### Aggregation

Allows to specify attributes, which will be used for build aggregated data based on a search query.
Only requested attributes will be returned.

We agreed with the following:
1. In case of empty list is provided no aggregations is returned
1. To simplify interface we are going to return all possible aggragation if **NULL** is provided

#### Meta Info

Allows to specify additional fields that need to be returned:
- totalCount
- totalPages

Example:
```php
 ["category", "price"] // provide aggregations by category and price
 [] // do not provide aggregations
 NULL // provide all possible aggregations
 
```


### API Details

Search (full text search) and Filtration of entities data is combined into one API.
1. ProductSearchInterface - Store Front API for product search by batch of search requests
1. ProductSearchRequestCriteria - Request criteria for product search
1. ProductResponseContainer - Response container for specified ProductSearchRequestCriteria

**Execution result is returned in the order of received requests**

We agreed, that the order of received result containers is equal to the order of sent requests. Service implementation has to guarantee this sort order.

```php

interface ProductSearchInterface {
    /**
     * @param ProductSearchRequestCriteria[] $request
     * @return ProductResponseContainer[]
     */
    public function search(array $request): array;
}

interface ProductSearchRequestCriteria
{
    /**
     * @return string|null Provide search term for full text search
     */
    public function getSearchTerm(): ?string;

    /**
     * @return \Magento\Framework\Api\Filter[] Provide filtration, e.g. [["field", "value", "condition_type"], ...]
     */
    public function getFilters(): array;

    /**
     * @return \Magento\Framework\Api\SortOrder[] Provide sorting, e.g. [["field", "direction"], ...]
     */
    public function getSort(): array;

    /**
     * @return string[] Provide pagination, e.g. ["pageSize", "currentPage"]
     */
    public function getPage(): array;

    /**
     * @return string[] List of scopes in format: ["name" => "value"], e.g ['storeId' => 3]
     */
    public function getScopes(): array;

    /**
     * @return string[] List of requested attributes. e.g. ['id', 'sku', 'name', 'url_key']
     */
    public function getAttributes(): array;

    /**
     * @return string[]|null Requested aggregations, e.g. ["attribute_name_1", "attribute_name_2", ...]
     */
    public function getAggregations(): ?array;

    /**
     * @return string[] Requested meta info, e.g. ["totalCount"]
     */
    public function getMetaInfo(): array;
}


interface ProductResponseContainer extends \Magento\Framework\Api\ExtensionAttributesInterface
{
    /**
     * @return string[] Product item data
     */
    public function getItems(): array;
    
    /**
     * @return string[][] List of requested aggregations
     */
     public function getAggregations(): array;

    /**
     * @return array
     */
    public function getMetaInfo(): array;
    
    /**
     * @return boolean Response status
     */
    public function getStatus(): bool;

    /**
     * @return string[]|null Error messages in case of failure
     */
    public function getError(): ?array;
}
```

#### Request with response example
```php
// Request
{
    "searchTerm": "simple product",
    "filters": [
        {
            "price": [
                {
                    "from": 8,
                    "to": 22
                }
            ],
            "category": {
                "eq": 1
            }
        }
    ],
    "sort": [
        {
            "price": "DESC"

    ],
    "aggregations": [
        "category",
        "price"
    ],
    "metaInfo": [
        "totalCount"
    ]
}

// Response for specific request

{
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "Car 1",
            "price": "22"
        }
    ],
    "aggregations": {

            }
        ],
        "price": [
            {
                "name": "12..24",

            }
        ]
    },
    "metaInfo": {
        "totalCount": 100,
    },
    "status": true,

### API Segregation
</summary>
Here you can find some thoughts that led us to the accepted solution 
  

Let's consider the necessity of introducing 2 dedicated APIs for Search (full text search) and Filtration of entities data.
Taking into account that Full Text Search is both filtration (non zero relevance) and sorting (by relevance desc) operation, and the limitation to have only one field we sort by, there is no sense to provide a method which set sorting for Search API as ordering by relevance is always pre-defined.


| ProductSearchRequestCriteria         | ProductFilterRequestCriteria |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| getFilters(): array; | getFilters(): array; |
| getPage(): array; | getPage(): array; |
| getScopes(): array; | getScopes(): array; |
| getAttributes(): array; | getAttributes(): array; |
| getAggregations(): ?array; | getAggregations(): ?array; |
| *getSearchTerm(): string;* | *getSort(): string;* |

The difference between Search and Filter in "search term" and "sort" methods:
1. Search API provides "search term" method, but has a lack of "sort"
1. Filter API has "sort" but no need to have "search term"

Pros:
1. More semantically correct interfaces (OOP friendly)
1. Both interfaces could evolve independently

Cons:
1. Necessity to extend and customize both interfaces

As an alternative option we can combine both APIs which allow search, filtering or both for entities (i.e. product).

Option 1. Add "search term" as an optional field

```php
interface ProductSearchInterface
{
    public function getSearchTerm(): ?string;
    public function getFilters(): array;
    public function getPage(): array;
    public function getScopes(): array;
    public function getAttributes(): array;
    public function getSort(): array;
    public function getAggregations(): array;
}
```

Pros:
1. single extension point

Cons:
1. we ignore field "sort" in case of fulltext search
1. "search term" is optional, because it's no needed for filtering requests

Option 2. Set "search term" via filters OR sort field.

```php
interface ProductSearchInterface
{
    public function getFilters(): array;
    public function getPage(): array;
    public function getScopes(): array;
    public function getAttributes(): array;
    public function getSort(): array;
    public function getAggregations(): array;
}
```

There are different options for set search term:

1. Option 2.1 Set search term via sort field 
```php
[
    'sort' => [
        'field' => "super car", 'type' => 'relevance',  // always sort by relevance, DESC
    ,
    ]
]
```

As a drawback we provide search term in not intuitive way and sorting field is responsible for filtering.

2. Option 2.2 Set search term via filters field.
```php
[
    'filters' => [
        ['field' => '*', 'value' => 'super car', 'condition_type' => 'match'] // Full text search by all fields. Sort by relevance added automatically
    ],
]

```
As a drawback we will ignore field "sort" in case of fulltext search.

3. Option 2.3 Set search term via filter field and provide *additional* sort direction by relevance for another term
```php
[
    'filters' => [
        ['field' => '*', 'value' => 'super car', 'condition_type' => 'match'],  // Sort by relevance added automatically
    ],
    'sort' => [
        'field' => "relevance('modern vehicle')", 'type' => 'ASC',
     ]
]

```
As a drawback we can receive not expected data. Currently this feature is not supported in Magento.

<summary>

#### Requested fields
</summary>


From the performance perspective, we must return only requested data.
There are two options how it can be achieved:


#### Option 1

We consider everything that API can request as "data". 
Use dot.annotation for describing requested fields without segregation between "entity data" and "response aggregation", "paging"...

We just need to follow a simple rule: 

**All requested fields are returned in corresponding containers**, e.g. "items.name" returned in "items" container

API expose XML (that should be autogenerated) with all possible fields and field types that can be requested

```php
/** 
 * @api
 * @fields: [
 *  "items.sku": string,
 *  "items.productId": int,
 *  "items.minimalPrice": float,
 *  "pageInfo.totalCount",
 *  "pageInfo.totalPages",
 *  "aggregations.category": string,
 *  "aggregations.price": string,
 * ]
**/ 

// Request

  "fields": [
      "items.name",
      "items.price",
      "aggregations.catagory",
      "pageInfo.totalCount"
  ],


// Response
{
    "items": [
     {
        "sku": "sku-777",
        "price": 45
     },
     {
        "sku": "sku-42",
        "price": 5
     }
    ],
    "pageInfo": {
        "totalCount": 42
    },
    "aggregation": [
        {
            "name": "category",
            "items": [
                {
                    "label": "Cat 1",
                    "count": 5
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

List of requested fields can be dynamically generated (e.g. for retrieve list of product attributes, aggregations,...)

**Proc**

1. Help to solve the "greedy" requirement
1. Delcarative, intutive interface, follow WYSIWYG approach
1. No need to itnroduce "hack" like \* (see Aggregations)
1. We do not need "aggregation" field in API Request - by the fact this field just request additional data

**Cons**

1. Need to follow agreements

After accepting this field **getAggregations** will be removed from ProductSearchRequestCriteria


#### Option2

We consider everything that API can request as different type of "data". 

Requested fields are splitted into 3 groups:
- entity data
- aggregations
- meta info


Due to we do not want to return data, that was not requested we add the following rules
1. All "data specific" arguments are optional (NULL)
1. If argument was not passed NULL is returned in Response object for this argument


```php
interface ProductSearchRequestInterface
{
// set filtrations 
    public function getSearchTerm(): ?string;
    public function getFilters(): array;
    public function getPage(): array;
    public function getScopes(): array;
    public function getSort(): ?array;

// request data...
    public function getAttributes(): ?array;
    public function getAggregations(): ?array;
    public function getMetaInfo(): ?array;
}
```


```php
// Request

  "fields": [
      "sku",
      "price",
  "aggregations": [
      "catagory"
  ],
  "metaInfo": [
     "totalCount",
     "currentPage"
  ]


// Response
{
    "items": [
     {
        "sku": "sku-777",
        "price": 45
     },
     {
        "sku": "sku-42",
        "price": 5
     }
    ],
    "aggregation": [
        {
            "name": "category",
            "items": [
                {
                    "label": "Cat 1",
                    "count": 5
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "metaInfo": {
        "totalCount": 42,
        "currentPage": 1
    }
}
```
