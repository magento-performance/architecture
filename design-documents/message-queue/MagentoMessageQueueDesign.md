## Message Queue Processing Design

Currently we have two types of implementations of QueueInterface.

| Implementation | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MySQL          | This is based on MySQL database, currently it doesn't support the Bulk APIs; this doesn't scale well and designed for out of the box experience; for practical purposes RabbitMQ should be utilized to handle large scale requirements |
| RabbitMQ       | RabbitMQ implementations is based on AMQP protocol, which supports callback mechanism and polling based approach as its supported by underlying channel implementation & specification |

### Consumers Runner Process

ConsumersRunner is the main class, which facilitates the processing of Queued Messages, and based on the configuration in **queue_consumer.xml**, it calls the appropriate ConsumerInterface implementation.

### Different Types of Consumers

This QueueInterface is been utilized by Consumer classes, there are currently three different implementations of ConsumerInterface

|      | Class Name    | Purpose / Description                                        |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Consumer      | This class is for both synchronous and asynchronous style message processing; in synchronous style topics, **response** is defined along with **request** in communication.xml; reponse queue name is made from original topic name by appending prefix. |
| 2    | MassConsumer  | This is mainly designed for asynchronous style message processing; primarily used for Async APIs and Async Bulk APIs |
| 3    | BatchConsumer | This class supports batch processing of messages, helps in picking & merging the messages to a specified batch size, and then process them together, before querying another batch |

## Queue Interface

The table below describes all the method expected to be implemented by the specific Queue provider, and the intention of what functionality is expected from these methods.

| #    | Method        | Purpose / Description                                        | Related RabbitMQ Method |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1    | dequeue()     | Get a single message from the queue                          | basic_get()             |
| 2    | acknowledge() | Acknowledge message delivery                                 | basic_ack()             |
| 3    | subscribe()   | Wait for messages and dispatch them, this is based on pub/sub mechanism, consumes the messages through callbacks, until connection is closed | basic_consume()         |
| 4    | reject()      | Reject message, messages gets returned to the queue          | basic_reject()          |
| 5    | push()        | Push message to queue directly without using exchange; it uses publish behind the scenes | basic_publish()         |
