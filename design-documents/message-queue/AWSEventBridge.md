##### Evaluation Table - Details

| Method        | Evaluation          | Implementation Readiness                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dequeue()     | Not Possible or N/A | Multiple **Targets** can be set, to receive the messages when they are available asynchronously. There is no concept of fetching the message from the Event Bus on-demand, its more of a serverless architecture. |
| acknowledge() | Not Possible or N/A | There is no need to acknowledge the message, AWS internally makesure that the Target receives the message. |
| subscribe()   | Not Possible or N/A | AWS related Targets can be set or subscribed for the EventBus based on the Rules; but we cannot set PHP Callback as Functions. |
| reject()      | Not Possible or N/A | The concept is not available or used.                        |
| push()        | Available           | PutEvents or PutPartnerEvents functions can be used for this purpose. |
